            num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank: the maximum number of tokens to dispatch, all the ranks must hold the same value.
            num_experts: the number of all experts.

                `[num_local_experts]` and be typed as `torch.int`. This is useful for online service EP load balance
                monitoring.

                This is useful for detecting and precisely localizing slow anomalies.
            use_fp8: whether to enable FP8 casting, with this, the received data will be a tuple of FP8 tensor and scaling factors.
            round_scale: whether round the scaling factors into power of 2.
            use_ue8m0: whether use UE8M0 as scaling factor format (available only with `round_scale=True`).
            async_finish: the current stream will not wait for the communication kernels to be finished if set.
            return_recv_hook: return a receiving hook if set. If set, the kernel will just do the RDMA request issues,
                but **without actually receiving the data**. You must call the received hook to make sure the data's arrival.
                If you do not set this flag, the kernel will ensure the data's arrival.

                if `use_ue8m0=False`. With `use_ue8m0=True`, the second one is packed and shaped as
                `[num_local_experts, num_max_dispatch_tokens_per_rank * num_ranks, hidden // 512]` with type `torch.int`.
